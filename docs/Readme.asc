= Diff.exe

Clean room, basic implementation of the diff utility.

Algorithm was original and not based on the existing implementations.

== The Algorithm
. Start at the first line and find the matching line in the secondary file (if present)
.. If a matching line is found, check to see if the next line matches as well, continuing until we've determined the total number of matching lines
.. Store this match as the greatest common subsequence
. Continue this pattern until we reach the end and have determined the single largest common subsequence for both files
. We have the largest subsequence, now we have to find the rest of the subsequences from largest to smallest
.. Split the file in two and recursively parse the text above and below the current largest subsequence for the next largest subsequence, storing each subsequence as we go along
.. Continue this pattern of recursively parsing the top and bottom of the current subsequence until no lines are left to parse
. We now have an ordered list of all the similarities, use this data to generate a list of deletions and additions from the primary and secondary files

== How to build it

=== Ensure build dependencies are installed 
 pip3 install meson
 apt-get install ninja-build

=== Build command (from root directory)
 meson builddir
 ninja -C builddir

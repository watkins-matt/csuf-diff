= Diff.exe
Matt Watkins <watkins-matt>

Acts as a slightly crappier version of the diff utility you probably
already have installed on your linux box.

== Why a clean room implementation?
I could have easily copied the existing algorithm, but I would simply be reimplementing someone else's work. I wanted to come up with the solution on my own so I chose to solve the problem without relying on existing documentation.

This is not to say that my solution is the best or the fastest possible (I'm sure it isn't), but it was much more thought provoking to figure out how to solve the problem with no outside help.

== The Algorithm
. Start at the first line and find the matching line in the secondary file (if present)
.. If a matching line is found, check to see if the next line matches as well, continuing until we've determined the total number of matching lines
.. Store this match as the greatest common subsequence
. Continue this pattern until we reach the end and have determined the single largest common subsequence for both files
. We have the largest subsequence, now we have to find the rest of the subsequences from largest to smallest
.. Split the file in two and recursively parse the text above and below the current largest subsequence for the next largest subsequence, storing each subsequence as we go along
.. Continue this pattern of recursively parsing the top and bottom of the current subsequence until no lines are left to parse
. We now have an ordered list of all the similarities, use this data to generate a list of deletions and additions from the primary and secondary files

== How to build it

=== Ensure dependencies are installed
 pip3 install meson
 apt-get install ninja-build

=== Build command (from root directory)
 meson builddir
 ninja -C builddir

=== Alternative for the lazy (but seriously, try meson and ditch cmake)
 clang src/diff.c
